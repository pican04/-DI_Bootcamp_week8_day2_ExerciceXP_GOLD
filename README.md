# DI_Bootcamp_week8_day2_ExerciceXP_GOLD


Exercise 1: DVD Rental
Instructions
You were hired to babysit your cousin and you want to find a few movies that he can watch with you.
Find out how many films there are for each rating.

Get a list of all the movies that have a rating of G or PG-13.
Filter this list further: look for only movies that are under 2 hours long, and whose rental price (rental_rate) is under 3.00. Sort the list alphabetically.

Find a customer in the customer table, and change his/her details to your details, using SQL UPDATE.
Now find the customer’s address, and use UPDATE to change the address to your address (or make one up).

Exercise 2: Students Table
Instructions
Continuation of the Day1 Exercise XPGold : students table



Update
‘Lea Benichou’ and ‘Marc Benichou’ are twins, they should have the same birth_dates. Update both their birth_dates to 02/11/1998.
Change the last_name of David from ‘Grez’ to ‘Guez’.


Delete
Delete the student named ‘Lea Benichou’ from the table.


Count
Count how many students are in the table.
Count how many students were born after 1/01/2000.


Insert / Alter
Add a column to the student table called math_grade.
Add 80 to the student which id is 1.
Add 90 to the students which have ids of 2 or 4.
Add 40 to the student which id is 6.
Count how many students have a grade bigger than 83
Add another student named ‘Omer Simpson’ with the same birth_date as the one already in the table. Give him a grade of 70.
Now, in the table, ‘Omer Simpson’ should appear twice. It’s the same student, although he received 2 different grades because he retook the math exam.
Bonus: Count how many grades each student has.
Tip: You should display the first_name, last_name and the number of grades of each student. If you followed the instructions above correctly, all the students should have 1 math grade, except Omer Simpson which has 2.
Tip : Use an alias called total_grade to fetch the grades.
Hint : Use GROUP BY.
SUM
Find the sum of all the students grades.


Exercise 3 : Items And Customers
Instructions
We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.

Part I

Create a table named purchases. It should have 3 columns :
id : the primary key of the table
customer_id : this column references the table customers
item_id : this column references the table items
quantity_purchased : this column is the quantity of items purchased by a certain customer

Insert purchases for the customers, use subqueries:
Scott Scott bought one fan
Melanie Johnson bought ten large desks
Greg Jones bougth two small desks
The table purchases should look like this:

id	customer_id	item_id	quantity_purchased
1	3	3	1
2	5	2	10
3	1	1	2


Here is the explanation of the first row:

id = 1, this is the auto-incrementing primary key
customer_id = 3, because the id of Scott Scott in the customers table is 3
item_id = 3, because the id of a fan in the items table is 3
quantity_purchased = 1, because Scott Scott bought one fan


Part II

Use SQL to get the following from the database:
All purchases. Is this information useful to us?
All purchases, joining with the customers table.
Purchases of the customer with the ID equal to 5.
Purchases for a large desk AND a small desk

Use SQL to show all the customers who have made a purchase. Show the following fields/columns:
Customer first name
Customer last name
Item name

Add a row which references a customer by ID, but does not reference an item by ID (leave it blank). Does this work? Why/why not?
